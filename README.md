A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


SeaQuant is a backtesting platform designed to help traders create and test their trading strategies. The platform provides a user-friendly interface that allows traders to build and deploy their trading strategies, and then backtest and analyze them using historical data.

With SeaQuant, traders can easily create their strategies using a range of tools, including drag-and-drop blocks, customizable indicators, and programming languages like Python. Once a strategy is created, it can be tested against historical data to evaluate its performance using a range of metrics such as win rate, profit and loss, and drawdown.

Once a trader has backtested their strategy and analyzed its performance, they can then deploy it for live trading. SeaQuant integrates with a range of brokerage firms and provides automated trading features, allowing traders to execute trades automatically based on their strategies.

Overall, SeaQuant provides traders with a powerful toolset for building, testing, and deploying trading strategies. Its user-friendly interface and comprehensive feature set make it an ideal platform for both novice and experienced traders.
